# Python-program-designed-to-verify-the-validity-of-a-user-s-password.
This a Python prompts users to enter a password of their choice, then assesses it against established criteria to determine its validity. If the password meets the requirements, it is deemed “Valid Password”; otherwise, it is labeled “Invalid Password,” and the program explains why. The program includes separate functions to check the following: the password’s length is at least eight characters, it contains both uppercase and lowercase letters, it includes a numeral, and it has one of the specified special characters (!, @, #, $). Would you like an example Python script that demonstrates these validation functions.
